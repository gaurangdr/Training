IPC

1. Pipes //anonymous communications channel
2. FIFO // same as pipe but have name
3. System V and Posix IPC
	1. shared memory (mmapm and shared memory)
	2. message queue
	3. semaphore

5. Signal

#######
A pipe is a mechanism for interprocess communication; data written to the pipe by one process can be read by another process. The data is handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. The pipe has no name; it is created for one use and both ends must be inherited from the single process which created the pipe.


1. Shared memory (system V)

	key_t ftok(char* "File Path", int num)
	int shmget(key_t, mem_size, permissions); //allocate mem and return shared memory id
	void * shmat(shmid, NULL, NULL); // return memory address

	shmdt(pointer)
